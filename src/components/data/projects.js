  paragraph: `Started off as a school project to create a todo app. In the app, one can create an account
        and sign in. When signed in you are redirected to the dashboard where you write todos, mark them as finished, delete, toggle between
        unfinished and finished, go to details page and update your todo. <br><br> During the summer I have worked details such as
        getting a loading spinner for signing up/signing in and error handling and error messages to the client side.
